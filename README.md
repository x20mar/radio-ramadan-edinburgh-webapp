==============================

Primarily developed for mobile platforms, the Radio Ramadan Web Application, will allow the user to access the radio station through the internet rather than relying on trying to access the FM signal or using the old flash player. The application itself will consist of four spaces

* Live - Where they can play/pause the stream and to see the now/next part of the schedule
* Schedule - Where they can access the full schedule for the station
* Listen Again - Using SoundCloud APIs, this will allow the user to listen to past shows
* Settings - Any settings that can be tweeked by the user will be here. Credits will appear here too

The first phase of the application will be to develop the web application for the Google Chrome Platform.
The second phases will be to streamline the application so that it will be better supported on mobile plaitforms. It will be compiled to "native web apps" using the Apache Cordova toolset. The priority of the mobile platform development will be as follows:

* Android
* iOS
* Blackberry
* Amazon Fire OS
* Windows Phone 8
